## 项目描述
arXiv:2608.20397v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) re-encode verbose tool schemas every turn, so prefill - quadratic in sequence length - dominates time-to-first-token (TTFT) as the tool registry grows. Nexus's primary lever is to decouple routing from the schema-prefill cost: an INT8 semantic lookaside buffer (SLB) with a calibrated cross-encoder margin gate selects tools by retrieval, and arguments are generated over a compressed textual signature (median 19 tokens) rather than over spliced key/value (KV) cache. This path is depth-independent: routing accuracy stays near 89% as the registry scales to 250 tools - where a concatenate-all-schemas baseline overflows the context window entirely - and it reaches a first-argument token 1.66x sooner than a full-schema re-prefill at a ~80% main-context token saving. As a secondary, bounded lever we transplant a compiled schema KV block directly into the live context. This is fundamentally limited by rotary position embedding (RoPE) phase drift: an anchored splice is output-exact, but off-anchor placement corrupts attention, so beyond a threshold P=256 Nexus repairs the seam with a depth-adaptive suffix redecode that escalates to a full re-prefill. The resulting never-regress property is a guarantee on output fidelity (top-1 agreement, D_KL approx. 0) - not on latency, which can dip to 0.98x before converging to parity - alongside a 1.1-1.7x TTFT speedup at moderate depth that narrows to parity at deep context. Two negative results bound the design: the off-anchor RoPE fidelity boundary, and the failure of a reference-free drift gate to predict drift (Spearman rho = 0.193). All measurements are from one model tuple (Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct Q4_K_M) on Apple-silicon unified memory; the qualitative boundaries generalize, while the quantitative envelope is tuple-specific.
