## 项目描述
arXiv:2608.10216v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Agent frameworks ship quality gates that compare text blocks by embedding-cosine similarity and decide at a fixed cutoff. Deduplication filters, semantic caches, drift guards, and answer grader gates deploy to answer the question: "Does this text still mean the same thing?" But the score answers a different question: "How much did the wording change?" We audit this gate class as a measurement instrument. In the cases these gates exist to catch, the two can run in opposite ways. Many times, reversing an instruction is a single word edit, while agreement often rephrases a sentence. The consequence is a safety check that fires backwards. The production drift guard we audited caught 0 of 56 meaning-breaking mutations, and one approved item, "withhold the study drug" -> "administer the study drug", came in at cosine 0.9608. We observed five shipped operating points, and balanced accuracy across 90 configuration-threshold-task cells never exceeded 0.700 (median 0.525). The same confounder also corrupted evaluations. A naively built corpus inherits this confounder and can return an inverted verdict, with a decision AUROC exactly 0.000 in 13 of 18 configuration-task cells (at most 0.040 in all 18) against 0.440-0.815 for the same nine configurations under a balanced 2x2 design. Twice in the effort it captured our own headline claims. Obvious repairs fail: an encoder swap and an overlap-conditioned gate (0.750 in-sample, 0.533 held-out) land at chance on separately authored held-out data, and an NLI drop-in did no better. Embeddings do still bear hope here, as the strongest two of nine configurations separated reversal from paraphrase at matched overlap (AUROC 0.79-0.90), but only a matched-pair audit reveals the deployment regime. We release the corpus method, harness, and frozen results, and contend that scores gated this way measure the wrong thing. We believe a valid instrument is buildable.
