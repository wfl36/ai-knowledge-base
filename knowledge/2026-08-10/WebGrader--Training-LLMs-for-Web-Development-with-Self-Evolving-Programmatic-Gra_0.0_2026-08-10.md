## 项目描述
arXiv:2608.06474v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language models increasingly generate complete websites from natural-language descriptions, and reinforcement learning has become a central approach to closing their remaining functional gap. This training regime is bottlenecked by reward design. Hand-authored browser scripts are executable yet costly to write for open-ended requirements, while VLM and GUI-agent graders scale but may issue verdicts before observing the decisive state. We propose WebGrader, a self-evolving programmatic grader that autonomously derives the required interaction flows from each website request, represents each flow as an executable Flow Contract, and uses its execution outcome as an RL reward. WebGrader materializes the generated project in a live browser, grounds target actions against the source code and live DOM, and collects visual, DOM, response, and persistent-state evidence along the same browser trajectory. A residual-driven offline loop then discovers reusable verifier skills, screens them on disjoint validation pages, and freezes the promoted skill graph before policy training. By separating test planning, action grounding, evidence collection, and semantic judgment, WebGrader issues a Pass verdict only after observing the requested transition. On WebGen-Bench, WebGrader trains an 8B policy to a 52.01% functional success rate, outperforming a matched appearance-plus-script reward by 7.88 points and surpassing o4-mini and DeepSeek-v4-flash. On WG-core-250, the policy reaches a Full Score of 44.953 and surpasses Qwen3-Coder-480B.
