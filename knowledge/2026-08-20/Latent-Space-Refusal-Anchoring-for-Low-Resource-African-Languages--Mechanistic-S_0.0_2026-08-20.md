## 项目描述
arXiv:2608.18089v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Instruction-tuned models often refuse harmful requests in English but comply with the same requests in Yoruba, Igbo, Igala, and Hausa. This suggests that the refusal mechanism is present in the residual stream but fails to activate for low-resource inputs. Recovering it normally requires labelled target-language data and retraining, neither of which is available at scale for most African languages. We introduce Latent Space Refusal Anchoring (LSR-Anchoring), a training-free method that extracts the refusal direction from English prompts and clamps it onto the residual stream at inference time. The primary variant, Mean-Activation Steering (MAS), operates across the four architectures we tested: Llama-3-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-7B. On Mistral and Qwen it recovers safety with benign degradation below 0.08. On Llama-3-8B it overcorrects, with Degraded Performance on Legitimate prompts (DPL) reaching 1.00. We address this with SAE-Derived Steering (SDS), which replaces the dense mean-difference direction with a single Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) feature and reduces Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence by 3.5-7x without benign collapse. Four languages transfer positively, but Arabic fails on every architecture and at every steering magnitude, indicating a geometric mismatch rather than a baseline effect. Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) accuracy drops remain below 0.35 percentage points at every effective steering magnitude.
