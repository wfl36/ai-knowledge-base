## 项目描述
arXiv:2609.38379v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently updated for various use cases, where filtering out misaligned training samples is a common practice for preventing post-update misalignment. However, alignment is inherently context-dependent: a recommendation that is aligned in one context may be inappropriate in another. For example, in response to the question "What should a researcher do with the research data?", recommending that the researcher preserve the data for reproducibility is aligned. In contrast, recommending data saving in response to "What should a mobile-app developer do with users' sensitive data?" may be inappropriate from a privacy perspective. Starting from this observation, we identify a post-training phenomenon where aligned training induces misaligned behavior in other contexts. We call this phenomenon **context confusion**. We demonstrate context confusion across three domains: (1) Gender Equality, (2) Privacy, and (3) Physical Safety. We further show that context confusion causes narrow misalignment, in contrast to emergent misalignment, and is not effectively reduced by injecting general alignment data, but can be substantially reduced by including targeted alignment data for the misaligned domain or providing in-context learning examples during inference. Lastly, we provide a mechanistic explanation of *context confusion*. We observe that queries from different domains can undergo similar representational shifts during the fine-tuning. Consequently, a query from a different domain may activate the same behavioral feature learned during fine-tuning, which causes the behavior to transfer to a context where it is misaligned. Based on our findings, we argue that it is difficult to predict the alignment state of a model after training by inspecting the training data alone, which highlights the importance of comprehensive post-training alignment evaluations.
