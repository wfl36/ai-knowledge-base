## 项目描述
arXiv:2607.26181v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Functional verification dominates integrated circuit (IC) front-end engineering effort, and a single missed bug that escapes to silicon can trigger a costly respin. Recent large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to automate this process, yet existing LLM-based approaches generate each component through independent single-turn calls with no shared context, leaving interface mismatches undetected and reported coverage disconnected from specification requirements. To address these challenges, we present GoGoTB, an agentic framework that achieves end-to-end verification closure through three subsystems: an agentic execution control layer, an evolvable knowledge system, and specification-grounded coverage closure. The execution control layer separates deterministic enforcement from LLM reasoning at every tool and stage boundary. The knowledge system dispatches methodology and design-specific expertise on demand. The coverage framework anchors every bin to a named specification behavior so that each residual gap has a diagnosable root cause and a targeted remedy. Tested on 8 register transfer level (RTL) designs without any human intervention, GoGoTB achieves 100\% environment generation success and averages 98.4\% line, 97.2\% branch, 97.0\% toggle, and 83.2\% functional coverage. No prior work successfully generates a complete verification environment or achieves meaningful coverage on the same benchmarks.
