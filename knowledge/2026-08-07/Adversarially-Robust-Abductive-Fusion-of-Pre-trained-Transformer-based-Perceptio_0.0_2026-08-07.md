## 项目描述
arXiv:2608.04190v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Deploying pre-trained perception models in novel environments degrades their accuracy under distributional shift, and assembling them alone does not recover it: combiners such as majority voting trade recall for precision and are brittle to coordinated failures. Prior metacognitive methods learn logical rules that flag a model's errors, but rely on hand-authored domain-knowledge cues (object-size priors, segmentation masks) that do not transfer to genuinely novel scenes. We show that this metacognitive layer can be learned without any domain knowledge by exploiting vector-space geometry: per-model Label Vector Pools (LVP), built from each model's own training embeddings, yield error-detection rules from the geometry of detections relative to training-determined prototypes, reaching parity with domain-knowledge rules to within $0.002$ every F1 on test set. Because the approach remains neurosymbolic, these geometric rules share a single logical framework and can still be complemented by domain knowledge when available. We frame the fusion of multiple imperfect ViT-based detectors as a consistency-based abduction problem solved at test time by an exact Integer Program (IP) and a polynomial-time heuristic. On an aerial-imagery benchmark of 15 weather-shifted test sets and six ViT detectors, our domain-knowledge-free layer matches the strongest majority-vote variant on clean data (within $0.005$ F1) and, unlike every majority-vote baseline, retains its performance under a coordinated label-flipping attack: at a $90\%$ flip rate it averages $0.42$ F1 versus $0.35$ for MV-Plurality (a $22\%$ relative gain) and attains the highest F1 on \emph{every} test set once the flip rate exceeds $0.4$
