## 项目描述
Hi HN! Excited to share our MCP Server at Hyperbrowser - something we’ve been working on for a few days. We think it’s a pretty neat way to connect LLMs and IDEs like Cursor &#x2F; Windsurf to the internet.<p>Our MCP server exposes seven tools for data collection and browsing:<p>1. `scrape_webpage` - Extract formatted (markdown, screenshot etc) content from any webpage<p>2. `crawl_webpages` - Navigate through multiple linked pages and extract LLM-friendly formatted content<p>3. `extract_structured_data` - Convert messy HTML into structured JSON<p>4. `search_with_bing` - Query the web and get results with Bing search<p>5. `browser_use_agent` - Fast, lightweight browser automation with the Browser Use agent<p>6. `openai_computer_use_agent` - General-purpose automation using OpenAI’s CUA model<p>7. `claude_computer_use_agent` - Complex browser tasks using Claude computer use<p>You can connect the server to Cursor, Windsurf, Claude desktop, and any other MCP clients with this command `npx -y hyperbrowser-mcp` and a Hyperbrowser API key. We&#x27;re running this on our cloud browser infrastructure that we&#x27;ve been developing for the past few months – it handles captchas, proxies, and stealth browsing automatically.<p>Some fun things you can do with it: (1) deep research with claude desktop, (2) summarizing the latest HN posts, (3) creating full applications from short gists in Cursor, (3) automating code review in cursor, (4) generating llms.txt for any website with windsurf, (5) ordering sushi from windsurf (admittedly, this is just for fun - probably not actually going to do this myself).<p>We&#x27;re building this server in the open and would love feedback from anyone building agents or working with web automation. If you find bugs or have feature requests, please let us know! One big issue with MCPs in general is that the installation UX sucks and auth credentials have to be hardcoded. We don’t have a solution to this right now but Anthropic seems to be working on something here so excited for that to come out. Love to hear any other complaints &#x2F; thoughts you have about the server itself, Hyperbrowser, or the installation experience.<p>You can check us out at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyperbrowser.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyperbrowser.ai</a> or check out the source code at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hyperbrowserai&#x2F;mcp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hyperbrowserai&#x2F;mcp</a>
