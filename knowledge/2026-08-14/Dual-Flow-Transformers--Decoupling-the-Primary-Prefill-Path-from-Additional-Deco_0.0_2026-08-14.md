## 项目描述
arXiv:2608.12385v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As large language models serve more requests, cumulative inference cost is becoming increasingly important relative to one-time training cost. The two inference phases stress hardware differently: prompt prefill is parallel and typically compute-bound, whereas autoregressive decode is sequential and often memory-bandwidth-bound. Conventional width or depth scaling increases both costs together because every added layer is evaluated in both phases. We ask whether additional learned computation can instead be allocated to continuation prediction while preserving the prompt-wide primary computation and a single persistent key-value (KV) cache. We introduce the Dual-Flow Transformer. Its primary flow is a complete causal language model that processes the prompt and writes the KV cache. The auxiliary flow is omitted during prompt processing and activated only from the final prompt position onward, adding continuation-prediction computation without writing persistent state or influencing the primary flow. The two flows share major attention, MLP, and output matrices, while using separate token embeddings and lightweight coupling. Sharing weights and the primary cache also creates opportunities to reuse loaded weights and cached keys and values during grouped execution. Across matched-token comparisons, Dual-Flow achieves lower validation loss across architectures and data configurations. In MoE models, the separation makes primary and auxiliary expert fan-outs independent controls over prompt cost, continuation cost, and predictive quality. We study two regimes: increasing decode computation at fixed prefill expert computation, and reallocating a fixed decode expert budget between the two flows. These experiments expose a prefill-decode-quality trade-off and demonstrate the potential of phase-specific expert allocation.
