## 项目描述
Hey HN! We&#x27;re building an open-source CMS designed to help creators with every
part of the content production pipeline.<p>We&#x27;re showing our tiny first step: A tool designed to take in a Twitter username
and produce an &quot;identity card&quot; based on it. We expect to use an approach similar
to [Constitutional AI] with an explicit focus on repeatability, testability, and
verification of an &quot;identity card.&quot; We think this approach could be used to
create finetuning examples for training changes, or serve as inference time
insight for LLMs, or most likely a combination of the two.<p>The tooling we&#x27;re showing today is extremely simplistic (and the AI is frankly
bad) but this is intentional. We&#x27;re more focused on showing the dev experience
and community aspects. We&#x27;d like to make it easier to contribute to this project
than edit Wikipedia. Communities are frustrated with things like Wordpress,
Apache, and other open source foundations focusing on things other than
software. We have a lot of community ideas (governance via vote by jury is
perhaps the most interesting).<p>We&#x27;re a team of 5, and we&#x27;ve bounced around a few companies with each other.
We&#x27;re all professional creators (video + music) and we&#x27;re creating tooling for
ourselves first.<p>Previously, we did a startup called Vidpresso (YC W14) that was acquired by
Facebook in 2018. We all worked at Facebook for 5 years on creator tooling, and
have since left to start this thing.<p>After leaving FB, it was painful for us to leave the warm embrace of the
Facebook infra team where we had amazing tooling. Since then, we&#x27;ve pivoted a
bunch of times trying to figure out our &quot;real&quot; product. While we think we&#x27;ve
finally nailed it, the developer experience we built is one we think others
could benefit from.<p>Our tooling is designed so any developer can easily jump in and start
contributing. It&#x27;s an AI-first dev environment designed with a few key
principles in mind:<p>1. You should be able to discover any command you need to run without looking at
   docs.
2. To make a change, as much context as possible should be provided as close to
   the code as possible.
3. AIs are &quot;people too&quot;, in the sense that they benefit from focused context,
   and not being distracted by having to search deeply through multiple files or
   documentation to make changes.<p>We have a few non-traditional elements to our stack which we think are worth
exploring. [Isograph] helps us simplify our component usage with GraphQL.
[Replit] lets people use AI coding without needing to set up any additional
tooling. We&#x27;ve learned how to treat it like a junior developer, and think it
will be the best platform for AI-first open source projects going forward.
[Sapling] (and Git together) for version control. It might sound counter
intuitive, but we use Git to manage agent interactionsand we use Sapling to
manage &quot;purposeful&quot; commits.<p>My last [Show HN post in 2013] ended up helping me find my Vidpresso cofounder
so I have high hopes for this one. I&#x27;m excited to meet anyone, developers,
creators, or nice people in general, and start to work with them to make this
project work. I have good references of being a nice guy, and aim to keep that
going with this project.<p>The best way to work with us is [remix our Replit app] and [join our Discord].<p>Thanks for reading and checking us out! It&#x27;s super early, but we&#x27;re excited to
work with you!<p>[Constitutional AI]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anthropic.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anthropic.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;constitutional-ai-harmles...</a><p>[Isograph]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isograph.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isograph.dev</a><p>[Replit]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replit.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replit.com</a><p>[Sapling]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sapling-scm.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sapling-scm.com</a><p>[Show HN post in 2013]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6993981">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6993981</a><p>[remix our Replit app]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replit.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;bolt-foundry&#x2F;repls&#x2F;Content-Foundry&#x2F;view#README.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replit.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;bolt-foundry&#x2F;repls&#x2F;Content-Foundry&#x2F;view...</a><p>[join our Discord]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;TjQZfWjSQ7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;TjQZfWjSQ7</a>

## 综合总结
前Facebook团队推出的开源CMS项目，致力于打造大厂级的开发者体验与AI优先的开发环境。项目目前展示了基于Twitter生成身份卡的初级AI应用，其核心价值在于探索AI辅助开发的工程实践（如用Git管理Agent交互、为AI提供聚焦上下文），并试图构建一个易于贡献的开源社区生态。

## 分析摘要
### 技术先进性 (评分: 4.0/10)
项目当前展示的AI功能较为简单，作者也坦诚AI表现不佳。技术亮点主要在于工程架构的组合与探索，如采用Isograph、Replit和Sapling构建AI优先的开发环境，以及用Git管理Agent交互、Sapling管理目的性提交的实践，但缺乏底层算法或模型层面的深度与突破。

### 实用性 (评分: 5.5/10)
对AI从业者的参考价值主要体现在“AI优先”的开发理念与工程实践上，例如如何为AI提供聚焦的上下文、如何将版本控制系统（Git/Sapling）适配到Agent工作流中。不过项目处于极早期，实际可用的AI工具链和产出尚不成熟，参考意义大于直接实用价值。

### 社区活跃度 (评分: 6.0/10)
获得了58个点赞和28条评论，对于Show HN类项目属于中等偏上的关注度。作者具有YC和Facebook背景，且明确表达了寻找贡献者和联合创始人的意愿，社区互动意图强烈，讨论质量有一定保证。
