## 项目描述
arXiv:2610.06917v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Prefill-decode disaggregation is becoming a common architecture for LLM serving because it separates two phases with distinct execution patterns and SLO objectives. Existing systems typically combine a fixed prefill/decode worker ratio with request routing across workers. However, real-world workloads exhibit both short bursts and sustained shifts in the prefill-to-decode demand ratio. As a result, a configuration that is well provisioned at one time may quickly become mismatched, causing latency SLO violations even when idle capacity exists elsewhere. Existing autoscaling mechanisms can add capacity, but they react slowly, require spare GPUs, and do not directly address short-timescale phase imbalance. We present FluidPD, a P/D-disaggregated serving system that provides SLO-aware in-place elasticity. FluidPD introduces two complementary mechanisms. FluidToken handles transient imbalance by offloading a bounded portion of prefill computation to decode workers when decode-side slack is available. FluidRole handles sustained imbalance by reassigning running workers between prefill and decode roles in place, avoiding model reload and engine restart. Both mechanisms are guided by lightweight pressure indices that expose prefill and decode-side resource pressure before they appear as SLO violations. Across production Azure trace workloads, FluidPD improves overall SLO attainment over static SGLang by up to 94.6 percentage points, demonstrating that SLO-aware in-place P/D elasticity improves service quality without provisioning additional workers.
