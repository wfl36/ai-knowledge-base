arXiv:2608.05153v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: GraphRAG underperforms vector RAG on citation precision in many reports, but where and why have remained corpus-bound. We present a triple-robustness analysis that holds the retrieval architecture fixed and varies three orthogonal axes embedder (local e5-small -> Azure text-embedding-3-small), corpus (DO-178C typed-edge requirements -> Wikipedia paragraph chains via MuSiQue), and judge (paired GPT-5.4 x GPT-4.1) across 4,440 main-matrix runs, 600 cross-corpus runs, and 1,200 paired faithfulness judgments. (C2a) Over-citation is architecturally universal: GraphRAG emits 11-15 IDs per answer at citation precision 0.12-0.23 and retrieval recall 0.68-0.87 across all three settings. (C2b) Its faithfulness consequence is corpus-conditional: in typed-edge DO-178C, GraphRAG faithfulness collapses 74%->40% across hops; on Wikipedia chains the same pipeline rises 42%->58% because over-cited paragraphs remain topically supporting. (C1) Stratum-conditional winners are corpus-conditional but embedder-robust: vanilla wins 2-hop on DO-178C, GraphRAG wins 2-hop on MuSiQue, identical under either embedder. (C3) Single-judge LLM faithfulness is fragile to retrieval state: same-judge self-kappa across embedders is 0.137 for GPT-5.4 (verdict change on 41% of items). A learned router on dense embeddings alone reaches macro-F1 0.86 on hop classification (C4). We argue triple-robustness is the minimum bar for trustworthy RAG architecture claims.
